# phoenix_hello_world

This project contains a "hello_world" application, generated with "mix phx.new hello_world".

The "main" branch will follow the latest Phoenix release and be updated accordingly.

The older releases will live on in dedicated branches, like "phoenix_1.7".

This repository also contains:

- VS Code settings and extensions recommendations
- <https://asdf-vm.com/>(ASDF) settings for Elixir and Erlang
- The bash script ".create_hello_world.sh" that recreates the example

Note: the "README.md" created by "mix phx.new" is in "README hello_world.md"
